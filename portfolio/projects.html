                    <h3>Personal Portfolio<br>September 2023 - Present</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>I initially took an unorthodox, design-based approach by wireframing and building the site's user interface using Figma, and then using the Locofy AI-based tool to convert the existing interface into React.</p>
                <aside>
                    <p>Locofy specializes in using AI to automate conversion of Figma designs into working front-end code, promising faster development at the expense of some control over the page structure. You can learn more <a href="https://www.locofy.ai/">here.</a></p>
                </aside>
                <br>While there was not a lot of tweaking involved to get the interface working the way I expected, I realized that in the context of a portfolio, where the majority of content would be static, this was an overkill approach that added unneeded complexity and website's performance, readability, and SEO.
                <hr>
                As part of a course on web client languages, I was tasked with rebuilding the website with this knowledge in mind. I am using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (again), but with a greater focus on optimizing performance and accessibility through semantically correct HTML and reducing asset sizes.
