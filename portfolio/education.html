                    <p>Under the UC Education Abroad Program I had the privilege of being able to study in Yonsei University as an international student.<br>
                        While studying abroad, I also joined Yonsei Taekwondo's international student division and was able to obtain an orange belt by December 2022.<br>
                        I also joined an expat church and was able to not only learn more about Korean life and culture, but also better understand the challenges involved in living and working long-term in a new country. <br>
                        This experience may have been short, but it shaped me into someone more willing to make mistakes, more ambitious in my goals, and more open to listening to others' experiences.</p>
