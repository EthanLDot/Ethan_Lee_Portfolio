                <ul>
                    <li>2000s kid</li>
                    <li>Computer science student at University of California, San Diego</li>
                    <li>Served as a software engineer intern, IT intern, and tutor</li>

                <p>
                    Since I started learning to code, my goal has been to make technology cooler, more accessible, and something everyone can interact with.<br><br>
                    I believe that when people use technology to do amazing things, they build a relationship of sorts with that technology, and I want to help others make the most out of those relationships to bring their visions to reality.<br><br>
                    I am a senior Computer Science student at UC San Diego, but more importantly I've been a team leader, a co-founder, a collaborator, an innovator, and a passionate coder. My career journey has enabled me to modernize the IT service desk of Anheuser-Busch, the world’s largest brewing company, teach hundreds of students from 15 nations how to code, lead one of UCSD’s most popular business courses, and develop relevant and impactful projects.<br> <br>
                    I am comfortable with <span style="color:#f00">Java, Python, and the HTML/CSS/JS trio</span> and I have experience with Agile development. With me in your organization, you don’t just get a fresh engineer; You get someone who knows how to communicate ideas with diverse audiences and is willing to solve problems that others would not address.<br>
                    I <em>am open</em> to offers to work.
